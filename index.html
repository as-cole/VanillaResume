          <h1>Adam Cole</h1>
          <p>Nothing motivates me more than a puzzle - an unanswered question, a problem that needs a solution. I am truly in my element when I am able to spend my time reviewing every aspect of a problem, then developing and implementing a solution. This process
            taps into two of my deepest driving forces â€“ creativity and critical thinking.</p>
          <p>However, all the passion, talent, and skill in the world is useless if you cannot communicate effectively. I coordinate with internal teams, vendors, and my clients to ensure our projects are executed efficiently. This requires communicating with
            colleagues at all levels of many organizations both internal and external. I often have to distill extremely technical information down to the clearest terms possible to convey how technical limitations or capabilities will affect a project.</p>
          <p>It is my passion for creative problem solving and effective communication that has enabled my success in turning an at-risk account into one of our most profitable. In a recent performance review I was called 'one of the most valuable if not the most
            valuable person on the account'. By consistently approaching problems as puzzles and communicating effectively I found solutions where previously we had been told there were none. As a result of this approach, we not only retained our client but
            doubled our revenue on the account.</p>
          <p>Feel free to reach out to discuss research, technology, front-end development, music, or anything else.</p>
